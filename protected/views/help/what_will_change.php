<h1>What Will Change?</h1>
<p>OpenEyes will replace the following, initially for cataract surgery
    and soon for other ophthalmic subspecialities:</p>
<ul>
    <li>details of the patient's medical, family and social history will
        now be captured in OpenEyes rather than on paper</li>
    <li>details of the ophthalmic eye exam will be captures in OpenEyes
        rather than on paper</li>
    <li>patient consent will be recorded in OpenEyes, with consent forms
        being printed from OpenEyes for the patient to sign</li>
    <li>cataract surgery patients will be listed in OpenEyes rather than
        on paper. The Bookings Team will have instant access to the
        relevant parts of the patient's medical record to assist with
        scheduling.</li>
    <li>biometry details and lens choice will be recorded on OpenEyes -
        at the moment, the initial biometry measurements and lens choice
        need to be made on paper as we cannot interface the existing IOL
        Master devices with the network</li>
    <li>prescriptions following cataract surgery will be made on
        OpenEyes - these will need to be printed out but mean the
        prescription details are recorded electronically</li>
    <li>all clinic and post-surgery correspondence will be produced in
        OpenEyes rather than by dictation. We have developed a set of
        templates specifically for East Kent and, once the letters have
        been approved within OpenEyes, they can be sent directly to GPs.</li>
    <li>all optometrist follow-up appointment details will be recorded
        online and sent immediately to OpenEyes rather than needing to
        wait for paper forms to be sent be mail, fax, etc.</li>
</ul>
