<h1>How Are Patients Added to OpenEyes?</h1>
<p>OpenEyes and PAS have been configured so that all patients being booked 
 into ANY ophthalmic clinic are added to OpenEyes. This will ensure that 
 even patients who are listed for cataract surgery from a non-cataract 
 clinic are available in OpenEyes.</p>
